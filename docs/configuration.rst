* `Charge on order` - Payments are immediately authorized and captured.

Authorization Mode
..................
* `Immediate` (default) - The authorization is processed immediately during the checkout.
* `Automatic` - The authorization is processed during the checkout. In case this call times out, an asynchronous authorization will be done afterwards.

Independent of the mode you decide for, make sure to only orders which are successfully authorized by Amazon Pay (order state: `Processing`).

.. note:: If you expect high order values, the **Automatic** authorization mode might be the best choice for your business.

The Amazon Pay multi-currency feature is designed for international merchants who list prices in more than one currency on their website and charge their customers the exact amount quoted on the site.

The multi-currency feature is offered by Amazon Services Europe SARL.
